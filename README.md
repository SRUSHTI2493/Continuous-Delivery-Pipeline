:small_blue_diamond: Set Up Git Repo


# Module 1: Set Up Git Repo
**In this module, you will set up a Git repo for your code so it can be easily accessed over the Internet**

## Overview
In this module, you will set up a repository for your code so it can be easily accessed over the Internet. In this example, we will be using GitHub, but there are other Git-compatible options you can use, including AWS CodeCommit. In one of the following modules you will connect this hosted repo to our pipeline, so every time you push a new commit to it your build process is started.

## What you will accomplish

**In this module, you will:**

:small_blue_diamond: Fork a GitHub repository to create a new one

:small_blue_diamond: Store code and metadata in GitHub

:small_blue_diamond: Interact with a code repository using Git

 # Implementation

**:large_orange_diamond:fork the starter repo**

assumes you have an existing GitHub account and Git installed on your computer. If you don't have either of these two installed, you can follow these step-by-step instructions.

:small_blue_diamond: In a new browser tab, navigate to GitHub and make sure you are logged into your account.

:small_blue_diamond: In that same tab, open the (https://github.com/SRUSHTI2493/Continuous-Delivery-Pipeline) repo.

:small_blue_diamond:Choose the white Fork button on the top right corner of the screen. Next, you will see a small window asking you where you would like to fork the repo.

:small_blue_diamond: Verify it is showing your account and choose Create a fork. After a few seconds, your browser will display a copy of the repo in your account under Repositories.

**:large_orange_diamond:Push a chnage to your new repo**

:small_blue_diamond: Go to the repository (https://github.com/SRUSHTI2493/Continuous-Delivery-Pipeline) and choose the green Code button near the top of the page.

:small_blue_diamond: To clone the repository using HTTPS, confirm that the heading says Clone with HTTPS. If not, select the Use HTTPS link.

:small_blue_diamond:  If you're on a **Mac or Linux computer**, open your terminal. If you're on Windows, launch Git Bash.

:small_blue_diamond:  In the terminal or Bash platform, whichever you are using, enter the following command and paste the URL you just copied in Step 2 when you clicked the clipboard icon. Be sure to change "YOUR-USERNAME" to your GitHub username. You should see a message in your terminal that starts with Cloning into. This command creates a new folder that has a copy of the files from the GitHub repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/SRUSHTI2493/Continuous-Delivery-Pipeline.git
```

:small_blue_diamond: In the new folder there is a file named app.js. Open app.js in your favorite code editor.

:small_blue_diamond: Change the message in line 5 to say something other than "Hello World!" and save the file.

:small_blue_diamond: Go to the folder created with the name Continuous-Delivery-Pipeline/ and Commit the change with the following commands:

```
git add app.js
git commit -m "change message"

```

:small_blue_diamond: Push the local changes to the remote repo hosted on GitHub with the following command. Note that you need to configure Personal access tokens (classic) under Developer Settings in GitHub for remote authentication.

```
git push

```

**:large_orange_diamond:Test your change**

:small_blue_diamond: In your browser window, open GitHub.

:small_blue_diamond: In the left navigation panel, under Repositories, select the one named Continuous-Delivery-Pipeline.

:small_blue_diamond: Choose the app.js file. The contents of the file, including your change, should be displayed

# Module 5: Finalize Pipeline and Test
**In this module, you will add a review stage to your countinuous delivery pipeline using AWS CodePipeline**

## Overview
In this module, you will use AWS CodePipeline to add a review stage to your countinuous delivery pipeline.

As part of this process, you can add an approval action to a stage at the point where you want the pipeline execution to stop so someone can manually approve or reject the action. Manual approvals are useful to have someone else review a change before deployment. If the action is approved, the pipeline execution resumes. If the action is rejectedâ€”or if no one approves or rejects the action within seven daysâ€”the result is the same as the action failing, and the pipeline execution does not continue.

## What you will accomplish
**In this module, you will:**
:small_blue_diamond: Add a review stage to your pipeline

:small_blue_diamond: Manually approve a change before it is deployed

**:large_orange_diamond: Create review stage in pipeline**
